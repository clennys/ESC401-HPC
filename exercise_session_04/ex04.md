# Exercise Sheet 04 (Dennys Huber)
## Exercise 01
- permissions: 
```bash
drwx------ 15 hdennys uzh8 8192 Mar 18 13:28 /users/hdennys # $HOME
drwxr-xr-x 2 hdennys uzh8 4096 Mar 17 21:39 /scratch/snx3000/hdennys # $SCRATCH
``` 
- The home directory is only accessable by my user and i'm able to read wright and execute programs. Therefore I'm not able to access other students home directory.
- In the SCRATCH users can read and execute programs of other member of the uzh8 group and the same is true for user, who are not in the same group("others").
- Default permissions when creating new file:
```bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdennys uzh8 0 Mar 18 13:40 test.txt # $HOME
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdennys uzh8 0 Mar 18 13:42 test0.txt # $SCRATCH
```
- __COMMIT__:
	- Permissions for User jbucko -> only he has read, wright and execute permission in this directory
	```bash
	drwx------+ 58 jbucko uzh27 8192 Mar 24 08:49 /users/jbucko/
	```
	- I would not be able to read nor write to the file /users/jbucko/hpc_exam_solution.txt because I don't have read nor write permission inside the directory.
- Only Owner permission:
```bash
chmod 700 directory # only user access
chmod 720 file # group read/write
``` 
- 000 then you have no read write or execute access, fix just set new permissions
## Exercise 02
- factor command shows all factor for a given number
- A prime number only has one number after the ':'
- if you use the -w for words and if there is more than two word then it has to be a composite if it's exactly one word then it's 1 or neither a composite nor a prime number and if it is exactly two words then it's a prime number
- check if the number is equal to certain value like
```bash 
factoring=$(factor $1 | wc -w)

if [[ $factoring -gt 2 ]]; then
```
- __COMMIT__: The script can be found [here](https://github.com/devnnys/hpc_esc_401_solutions/blob/main/exercise_session_04/exercise03/isprime_wc). 
	| number        | runtime       | prime |
	| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
	| 4230283       | 0.003521119 s | yes   |

## Exercise 03
- __COMMIT__:
