Exercise 2 [Bash scripting 1 - Changing the line spacing of a text file]
Write a script that reads each line of a target file (you can create your own file arbitrarily),





then writes the line back to stdout, but with an extra blank line following. This has the effect
of double-spacing the file.
• Include checks to see whether the script gets the necessary command-line argument (a
filename), and whether the specified file exists.
• When the script runs correctly, modify it to triple-space the target file.
• Write a script to remove all blank lines from the target file, single-spacing it.
