# Exercise Sheet 08 (Dennys Huber)

### Exercise 01
- The snapshot with the installed packages(inc. OpenMP and OpenMPI) is called [dennhu_HPC_gcc_cowsay_openmp_openmpi](https://cloud.s3it.uzh.ch/project/images/b9a5587c-0a85-47cc-805e-a9e372f5fc1f/).

### Exercise 02
- The Docker file can be found [here](https://github.com/devnnys/hpc_esc_401_solutions/blob/main/exercise_session_08/Dockerfile).
- Due to pip being outdated, I was unable to install numpy etc. on trusty and therefore I switched to bionic.
- In order to run the image I used the following command on my local maschine (fedora linux):
```bash
sudo docker run  -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v $(pwd)/poisson_SERIAL/output:/poisson_SERIAL/output poisson
```
- And the dockerhub repository is [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dennyshuber/hpc_ex08_poissonsolver).
