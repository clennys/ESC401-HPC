# Exercise Sheet 02 (Dennys Huber)
## Notes
- run program on $SCRATCH more resources available than on $HOME
- Normal:
- Debug: fast, but only limited time to run
- execute program with:  'sbatch myfirstobject'
- MPI: Each process has independent memory. 36 cores with 36 processes
- OMP: 36 cores with one process. They have one big shared memory.
## Exercise 01
- My github repo: [devnnys/hpc_esc_401_solutions](https://github.com/devnnys/hpc_esc_401_solutions)
- In Order to interact with github.com I added a ssh authentication to my account with a public ssh key, which I generated on piz daint. Now everything is working as expected.
## Exercise 02
- 'cc':  C and C++ compiler
- 'O3' turns on all optimizations specified by -O2 and also turns on the -finline-functions, -funswitch-loops, -fpredictive-commoning, -fgcse-after-reload and -ftree-vectorize options.
 - 'O0':  Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected results.  -> This is the default
 - Change Prg-Env from PrgEnv-cray which is the default to:
 ```bash
	 module switch PrgEnv-cray PrgEnv-gnu
 ```

 ## Exercise 03
 -  'sinfo -p debug':  View information about Slurm  partition debug
  - view jobs of any user with '-u' and optionally you can specify the partition with '-p'
```bash
  squeue -u <username> -p shared
 ```
 - add the following comments to the  bash script for the output.log and error.log file:
 ```bash
#SBATCH --output=output.log
#SBATCH --error=error.log
 ```
 - The output files and the sbatch scripts can be found here:
